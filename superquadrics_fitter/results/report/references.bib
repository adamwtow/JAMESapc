abstract = {Superquadrics are able to represent a large variety of objects with only a few parameters and a single equation. We present a superquadric representation strategy for automotive parts composed of 3-D triangle meshes. Our strategy consists of two major steps of part decomposition and superquadric fitting. The originalities of this approach include the following two features. First, our approach can represent multipart objects with superquadrics successfully by applying part decomposition. Second, superquadrics recovered from our approach have the highest confidence and accuracy due to the 3-D watertight surfaces utilized. A novel, generic 3-D part decomposition algorithm based on curvature analysis is also proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed part decomposition algorithm is able to segment multipart objects into meaningful single parts efficiently. The proposed superquadric representation strategy can then represent each individual part of the original objects with a superquadric model successfully. Â© 2004 SPIE and IS&amp;T.},
